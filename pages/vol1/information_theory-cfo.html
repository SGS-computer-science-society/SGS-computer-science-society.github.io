            <h1>Information Theory And Wordle</h1>

            <h2>The Beginning - Information Theory</h2>

                <p>Information theory is the mathematical treatment of concepts, parameters and rules of communicating a message through communication systems. Founded by Claude Shannon in 1948 with the release of his paper called “A Mathematical Theory of Communication”, who was interested in how much information something could give. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In short, he introduced many ideas that are still used to this day such as a “bit” in terms of information and entropy which is what we will be exploring in this article. </p>

            <br>
            <h2>The Bit</h2>

                <p>A bit is short for “binary digit”; the number of bits in a given system is equivalent to the number of yes/no questions you would have to ask to achieve the same conclusion. For example, to find a piece on a chessboard, you would have to ask if the piece is in the left half of the board, then ask if it is in one of the halves of the half it is in and so on 6 times in total. Splitting your sample size into 2 each time you ask a question, until you reach the exact position.</p>
